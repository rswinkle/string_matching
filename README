string_matching

This is just a collection of for string matching algorithms in C.

Rabin-Karp
automata/DFA
Knuth-Morris-Pratt
Boyer-Moore


I've tested them by hand fairly thouroughly but I intend to add some
test cases and maybe alternate versions that give the line number and position
in the line rather than the absolute offset (0 is beginning of file).

Rabin-Karp, automata and KMP algorithms I based off the psuedo-code
in Inroduction to Algorithms, Corment et al (3rd Edition).

Boyer Moore I took what was on Wikipedia and modified it.  I used my own
prefix function (though they're virtually identical of course being so simple)
and I changed the good_suffix function completely to compute the strong suffix rule
instead of the weak suffix rule that they were computing.  I also changed how it
returns results of course so it can return more than one.

I should probably add that I submitted my revised boyer-moore code to wikipedia in place
of the C implementation that used to be there so the code there is exactly my code here.
It's been there for over a month now so I guess that means it's an obscure enough
page that it's rarely reviewed and/or people don't care enough to check, or it's
correct.  I'm guessing the former is true and hoping the latter.

I think that's about it.
